# Srpingboard

The materials in this repository were created for the Springboard Foundations of Data Science Certificate. This is a curriculum which includes probability/statistics, data wrangling, data exploration, data visualization and machine learning.  All analysis was completed using the R programming language.

### Capstond Project - Analyzing Credit Card Default Rates

This project examined the default rate for 30,000 credit card holders of a Taiwanese bank in 2005. 

### Data Story 

Is it possible to create a predictive model that can help credit card issuers reduce their default rates? Can we identify the characteristics of borrowers that may lead to higher or lower rates of default versus an average or baseline default rate?

### Data Wrangling

Data was cleaned and reformatted using packages from the tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr).

### Data Exploration/Visualization

Examine each independent variable versus default.

### Machine Learning

Employed three different machine learning methods: logistic regression, Regression Tree, and Random Forest
